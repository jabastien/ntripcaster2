Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
NtripCaster is a server for GNSS data.

- See document "INSTALL" for installation description.

- The server can started through script "ntripcaster start" in the binary
  directory. Options "stop" and "restart" are available as well.

- You can administrate the server through the admin console, that starts
  automatically after the startup sequence (when not started in background mode,
  which is the default). Type "help" for a list of available commands.

- To access the server through a web browser, just enter the servername (or IP),
  the port and the mountpoint "/admin" as url
  (e.g. "http://ntripcaster.here.org:2101/admin").

- Go to the configuration directory and adapt the configurations files as
  needed. The default files should be installed with the extension ".dist" to
  allow testing own changes. Following files exist:
  ntripcaster.conf   main configuration
  clientmounts.aut   stream authentication for ntrip clients
  sourcemounts.aut   stream authentication for ntrip sources (Ntrip 2.0)
  users.aut          user definitions
  groups.aut         group definitions
  sourcetable.dat    the sourcetable containing stream information
  If you want to use user and password authenticated streams, you need to edit
  the .aut files accordingly.
  In these files you will find help about what can be specified there and how to
  do that.

- Since version 2.0.10 you can run multiple instances one one installation.
  Create subdirectories in the configuration directory and use
  "ntripcaster start <dirname>"  to handle the instances. You need to adapt the
  watchdog filename and the pidfilename accordingly. So
    /var/run/ntripcaster/caster.pid
  becomes
    /var/run/ntripcaster/caster_subdirname.pid
  and the watchdog file is handled alike. This way multiple instances are
  possible as long as the settings of each instance do not conflict.
